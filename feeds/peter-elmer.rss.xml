has been funded by the National Science Foundation's &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504817"&gt;Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation&lt;/a&gt; (SI2) program. We are just kicking off the project, and will be updating these web pages and adding posts as we go along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General news will be posted to this website's blog, but we've also created a

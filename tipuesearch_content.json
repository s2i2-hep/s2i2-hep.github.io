In such projects, success requires large-scale collaboration; software is the glue that enables teams of researchers to work together to exploit accelerators, telescopes and other large scientific instruments. Building the requisite software is technically challenging because computing technologies (processors, storage, networks) are evolving rapidly and data volumes are increasing rapidly. The primary goal of the S2I2/HEP conceptualization project is to prepare a strategic plan for a potential NSF Scientific Software Innovation Institute (S2I2) to develop software for experiments taking data in the \"High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider\" (HL-LHC) era in the 2020s. To prepare the strategic plan for an NSF S2I2, as well as a larger HEP community white paper on software and computing, we are organizing a number of workshops between Fall 2016 and Summer 2017 in collaboration with the HEP Software Foundation . More information about these workshops, and the related planning, will be forthcoming by September 2016 on this webpage and via our Google Group . The S2I2-HEP conceptualization project is part of the NSF's Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2) program.","tags":"pages","title":""},{"url":"/pages/jobs.html.html","text":"Cincinnati Position already filled. Nebraska The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is currently searching for a new Software Engineer hire to work on the DIANA project. Within the DIANA project, Nebraska is focusing on improving the performance and interoperability of ROOT I/O. Interested applicants should apply to http://employment.unl.edu/ under requisition S_150926. A summary from the posting's job description (https://employment.unl.edu/postings/47681): The Holland Computing Center (HCC) is a large High Performance Computing facility supporting the NU system. Position will work with other HCC personnel on the DIANA/HEP project which focuses on improving performance, increasing interoperability between HEP software analysis tools and other data-intensive scientific computing ecosystems (such as Apache Spark). Responsibilities include design and implementation of application interfaces; interacting with, using and managing large datasets and solving data-centric problems; organizing, visualizing and communicating digital data effectively. Position serves in both technical and management roles, working closely with technical specialists (e.g. application developers) and with user support (e.g. researchers). Position develops state-of-the-art data analysis tools for experiments which acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Criminal background check will be conducted. Excellent benefits including staff/dependent scholarship program. Applicant review begins Feb 8. View requisition S_150926 at https://employment.unl.edu for details and to apply.
